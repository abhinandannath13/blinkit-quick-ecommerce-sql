# Blinkit Order Analytics Project

This project analyzes Blinkit's order data to get business insights.  
The dataset is taken from **Kaggle** and processed into a fact table (`order_fact`) using SQL joins.  
The table combines information about orders, customers, products, delivery, and feedback.

## What I Did
- Built a clean consolidated table `order_fact` with all business details.
- Wrote SQL queries to analyze:
  - Daily and monthly sales trends
  - Top products and categories by revenue
  - Average delivery time and reasons for delays
  - Customer segment sales performance
  - Store-wise and delivery partner efficiency
  - Customer feedback sentiment and average rating
  - Margin contribution by category

## Why It Helps
- Management can see **sales performance** by product, customer, store, and delivery partner.  
- Helps find **bottlenecks in delivery** and improve operations.  
- Useful for understanding **customer satisfaction and loyalty**.  
- Provides **profitability insights** with margin analysis.  

## Next Step
The next step is to build a **Tableau Dashboard** for sales trend and delivery insights.  
I have already created the first **Sales Trend Dashboard** and will extend it with customer and delivery analysis.
